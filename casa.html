    <h1 class="small">CASA-Mi Espacio Program</h1>
    <p><a href="http://welcomingfallschurch.org/">Welcoming Falls Church</a> is excited to partner with <a href="https://wearecasa.org/">CASA</a>, a non-profit organization serving the immigrant community, to provide summer tutoring for high school students in Northern Virginia.</p>
    <p>Need: The CASA-sponsored program, <a href="https://wearecasa.org/programs/mi-espacio/">Mi Espacio</a>, provides structured activities, instruction on life skills, and academic support for 10-15 students each weekday afternoon. Volunteer tutors will help students improve competency in core academic subjects.</p>
    <p>Opportunity: Welcoming Falls Church and CASA will connect volunteer tutors with students who need assistance in subjects such as math, science, or reading. Tutoring will be one-on-one, conducted virtually via Google Meet. Curriculum will be provided. Most students in Mi Espacio speak English as a second language and would benefit from both academic instruction and informal conversation.</p>
    <p>Schedule: The tutoring program will run for nine weeks, June 14 to August 13. Each tutor will have the opportunity to serve one hour per week, either as one session or in two 30-minute sessions, 3:45pm or 4:15pm any weekday. Tutors can let CASA know their preferred time and days, as well as planned absences. Upon completion of the program, CASA and Welcoming Falls Church will certify the community service hours.</p>
    <p>Apply: We're seeking high school juniors, seniors, or college-age volunteers who would like to serve with this program. (Parental approval will be required for those under 18.) Basic familiarity with the Spanish language is helpful but not required. If you have questions, contact <a href="mailto:kevinhurst@me.com">Kevin Hurst</a> or <a href="mailto:hjordan414@gmail.com">Hannah Jordan</a>. To apply, complete <a href="/assets/WFC-CASA Tutoring - Volunteer Registration Form.docx">this form</a>-a digital signature is fine-and <a href="mailto:kevinhurst@me.com">email it to Kevin Hurst</a>. This is a great opportunity to serve the local community and to help high school students who are eager to learn to prepare for a successful school year.</p>
