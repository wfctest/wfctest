    <p><strong>Welcoming Week Community Food Drive</strong></p>
    <p>The Welcoming Falls Church Community Food Drive encourages all Falls Church residents to come together to serve those in need. The Food Drive will begin on September 12 and continue through October 3. We will have dozens of dropoff points around the community. We'll make it easy to serve your neighbor!</p>
    <p>The Food Drive mostly benefits Spend Yourself Food Pantry, which has a well-established presence on Glen Carlyn Road in Seven Corners, although our Girl Scout partners will be making a much smaller donation to Food for Others.</p>
    <p>Please sign up to be a donation point <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/10c0b45acaa28a13-welcoming">here</a>, and we'll be in touch soon with the details on how to get your yard sign and what you should do with the food.</p>
    <p>Thanks for your support and we look forward to an extremely successful drive. If you have any questions, please email Steve Mostow at <a href="mailto:smostow@yahoo.com">smostow@yahoo.com</a> (subject line: Food Drive).</p>
    <p>We will update this site soon with the details of where you can drop off your donations along with a list of what we need.</p>
    <p><strong>About Welcoming Falls Church</strong></p>
    <p>Welcoming Falls Church is building a community of neighbors. Our goals are hospitality toward immigrants and refugees and opportunity for us all. We believe that by engaging locally we can overcome divisions and reinforce some of our society's greatest strengths. Inspired by a national movement called <a href="http://welcomingfallschurch.org/about-welcoming-america">Welcoming America</a>, we are grassroots, apolitical, and public-private in character. We invite you to learn more and to join us.</p>
    <p><strong>About Welcoming Week</strong></p>
