            <p>"Welcoming Week" is observed annually in September by communities that are part of the welcoming movement. What a fantastic kick off we had to our first Welcoming Week in September 2018--and did even more to reach the community, with a great group of Community Partners, in September 2019.</p>
            <p><a href="mailto:welcomingfallschurch@gmail.com">Email us</a> to let us know if you are interested in getting involved in Welcoming Week 2020. We’ll start meeting even before the end of 2019 and form a Steering Committee, to plan for even more impact in the community in September 2020!</p>
            <h3>Welcoming Week 2019</h3>
            <p>We had a great Welcoming Week in September 2019! We started with our First Annual Welcoming Week Ice Cream Party (co-sponsored by Little City Creamery) at Falls Church’s new, downtown park, and continued with no fewer than 11 events and activities here in Falls Church.</p>
            <p>Our big event was one to remember: <a href="http://www.imbolombue.com/behold-the-dreamers">Imbolo Mbue</a>, acclaimed author of <a href="http://www.imbolombue.com/behold-the-dreamers">Behold the Dreamers</a>, helped us kick off Welcoming Week in Falls Church, speaking about "Immigration and the American Dream" to over 180 at George Mason High School and 75 at the Tysons-Pimmitt Hill Regional Library. See <a href="assets/Welcoming Falls Church - Imbolo Mbue Event at GMHS - Program - Final.pdf">here</a> for the final program from Ms. Mbue’s talk at GMHS. Ms. Mbue, who has <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2017/06/26/oprah-picks-debut-novel-behold-the-dreamers-for-book-club/103197042/">Falls Church ties</a>, also met with teachers from Mary Ellen Henderson Middle School and GMHS, and video clips from her talk were shown to all GMHS students, with discussion led by teachers, the following week.</p>
            <p>For a full rundown of Welcoming Week 2019 activities, see <a href="/assets/Welcoming%20Falls%20Church%20-%20Welcoming%20Week%20Schedule.pdf">here</a>.

            <h3>Welcoming Week 2018</h3>
            <p>For our first Welcoming Week last fall, the Falls Church City Council honored Welcoming Week with a proclamation support of Welcoming Falls Church. We then participated in four awareness-building events, at the Falls Church Fall Festival (<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/CQ29FA6GWLTvkFUK8">see photos</a>), the Falls Church Education Foundation’s Run for the Schools (<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/CQ29FA6GWLTvkFUK8">see more photos</a>!), the Falls Church Elemetary PTA’s Ice Cream Social and Info Fair, and the Willston Multicultural Center’s Fall Festival.</p>
            <p>Thank you so much to Katie Adams, Greg Anderson, Win Dayton, Linda Doornsbosch, Debbie Liang, and Mike Sakata for representing Welcoming Falls Church at the very start of our effort to get the word out about Welcoming Falls Church!</p>
