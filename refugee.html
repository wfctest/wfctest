        <p>Alan Gratz joins Welcoming Falls Church on October 28, 2020, for a virtual discussion of his New York Times bestselling novel, Refugee. This award-winning book follows three children at three different points in time, all connected by the same goal: escape. Refugee is appropriate for children 8 years and up and provides an unflinching look at the lengths some young people must go through to find safety. Gratz’s presentation is family-friendly and will include a 30-minute talk about Refugee as well as a 30-minute Q&A session.</p>

    <p>Our hope is that it will deepen Gratz fans' love of the book and appreciation for the topic. For students that have not read the book, our hope is that it will inspire them to explore the history of how our nation and our community have welcomed so many refugees over the years. </p>
    <p><strong>Online discussion with Alan Gratz.</strong> This talk will be streamed twice - 11am-12pm, during the school day (in partnership with Mary Ellen Henderson Middle School), and 4-5pm, for families, community organizations, and others that are seeking some inspiration. October 28 is National Immigrants' Day and the anniversary of the dedication of the Statue of Liberty. Join us to celebrate how welcoming immigrants and refugees - more important than ever in our community!</p>
